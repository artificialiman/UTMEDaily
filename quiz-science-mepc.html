const P1 = `The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is one of the most ecologically sensitive areas on the continent. For decades it has been the economic backbone of the nation, supplying the crude oil that funds the federal budget. Yet the communities that live above these oil deposits have seen little of the resulting wealth. Pipelines cut through fishing villages; oil spills blacken creek water that families depend on for drinking and farming. Flares burn day and night, releasing gases that researchers have linked to respiratory illness and soil degradation.

Successive governments have promised remediation, compensation, and development. Some funds have been released; fewer have reached their destinations. The gap between policy announcement and ground-level reality has bred a deep scepticism among Delta communities — a scepticism that, when it tips into militancy, costs the nation far more in lost production than any cleanup programme would have cost in the first place.

The lesson appears simple enough: sustainable resource extraction requires that the people who bear its environmental costs share meaningfully in its economic rewards. That this lesson has been stated so often, and applied so rarely, points to a failure not of knowledge but of political will.`;

const P2 = `Language is not a neutral vessel. Every word carries the sediment of the culture that shaped it, and every sentence is an act that positions speaker and listener within a web of social relations. When a child acquires her mother tongue, she is not merely learning labels for objects; she is inheriting a way of perceiving the world, a set of distinctions her community considers worth marking, and a repertoire of silences — things that exist but for which her language provides no ready name.

This observation has given rise to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, sometimes called linguistic relativity, which in its strong form claims that language determines thought. Most contemporary linguists reject the strong version: speakers can and do think about things their language lacks words for. The weaker claim — that language influences habitual patterns of thought and attention — enjoys considerably more empirical support. Colour perception studies, spatial reasoning experiments, and cross-linguistic analyses of time metaphors all suggest that the grammar and vocabulary of one's first language leave measurable traces on cognition, even when the speaker is performing tasks that seem entirely non-linguistic.`;
