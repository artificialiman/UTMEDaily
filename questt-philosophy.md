# The Questt Philosophical Base

## The Exam's Honest Purpose
UTME is a **matriculatory exam** — its job is fair, scalable gatekeeping for millions of candidates competing for limited university spots. It is designed to be passable by a well-prepared average student. Its repetitiveness, its pattern library, its finite testable surface — these are features, not flaws. The design is working exactly as intended.

This is the first thing a student must understand: **the ceiling is known, and it is reachable.** That is not a compromise. It is an invitation.

AP exams exist to differentiate the exceptional — depth is their entire point. UTME exists to confirm readiness. Treat it accordingly.

## The Marking Scheme Is a Weapon
UTME scores on a **2.5 mark base: +4 for correct, -1 for wrong, 0 for skipped.**

This is not a small detail. It means:
- A **random guesser** across 4 options expects **exactly 0** net gain per question
- A student who guesses blindly **loses confidence and marks simultaneously**
- A student who **skips preserves their score**
- A student who **eliminates even one wrong option** before guessing shifts the odds meaningfully in their favour

The scheme is specifically designed to punish guessing and reward knowledge. **60% genuine knowledge outperforms 100% guessing.** Understanding this converts test strategy into marks.

## The Scaffolding Principle
Every UTME question is written in two languages before it is written in any subject: **English and Mathematics.** These are not subjects — they are the medium. A student who cannot parse a question or execute a basic theorem is failing the scaffolding, not the content. Scaffolding must be reinforced first.

## The Faculty Dichotomies
Within every faculty, subjects map to recognisable archetypes:

**Sciences**
- Physics — structured, elegant, but booby-trapped with domain crossovers
- Chemistry — dense, self-contained, internally logical; borrows little, demands immersion
- Biology — a vocabulary and register exam wearing a science coat

**Commerce Faculty**
- Government — the Chemistry of its faculty; rewards going deeper, not wider
- Accounting — the Physics; procedural and clean until the Math dependency surfaces
- Commerce — the Biology; master the register, pass the exam

**Cross-faculty**
- Geography and History are estranged twins — same raw material, divergent methods
- Literature sits downstream of English fluency; it is close reading plus set-text recall

## The Crossover Trap
The most dangerous questions are not the hard ones — they are the ones where **the blocker is not the subject being tested, but a hidden prerequisite from another domain.** A student can know all of Physics and fail a projectiles question because it silently required cone geometry.

These crossover questions are most concentrated in Physics (and its faculty equivalents). Identifying and drilling them first unlocks multiple subjects simultaneously, because the prerequisite once learned becomes a tool everywhere.

## The Dependency Principle
Subjects have a natural preparation order determined by their dependencies:

> Physics → English → Chemistry → Biology

Physics forces Math fluency and gives Chemistry its grounding. English prevents misreading from silently draining marks across every subject. Chemistry rewards immersion once the foundations exist. Biology, last, is mostly vocabulary — and by then the register comes easier.

In the Commerce faculty, the same logic applies in its own order.

## Why Exams Repeat Questions
UTME repeats question patterns because **the testable surface of each subject is narrower than the conceptual depth beneath it.** The exam tests recognition and application of a finite pattern library. This is exploitable — spaced repetition of failure patterns is the exploit.

This repetition is not a sign that subjects lack depth. It is the floor doing its job. The depth is real — AP-style exams reveal what UTME, by design, does not need to test. Students who go beyond the floor do so in university, on their own terms.

## The Agent's Mandate
This philosophical base means the agent's job is never simply to present questions. It is to:

1. Communicate clearly: **the ceiling is known and reachable — this is good news**
2. Identify where the student's scaffolding is weak
3. Surface crossover traps before they become exam-day surprises
4. Sequence content along dependency lines, not syllabus order
5. Treat repeated failures as diagnostic signals, not just wrong answers
6. Teach the marking scheme as strategy — knowledge beats guessing by design
7. Honour the depth beneath the surface — prepare students for understanding, not just passing

**The exam is a floor, not a ceiling. The floor is fair. Clear it with confidence.**
